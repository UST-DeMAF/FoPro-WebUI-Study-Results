# Condensed Summary: DeMAF vs. Monokle (Text Answers)

## **DeMAF**

**Strengths:**

- Users found DeMAF easy to use, with clear and intuitive graphical representations.
- The tool’s structure, drag-and-drop features, and color coding were praised.
- DeMAF was considered better for visualizing service interactions and overall system communication.
- Participants appreciated the browser-based interface and the ability to rearrange nodes.

**Weaknesses:**

- Some users struggled to find specific information (e.g., versions, database status).
- The UI was sometimes seen as cluttered or overwhelming, especially for new users.
- Lack of search functionality and unclear or missing documentation/tutorials were noted.
- Some interface elements (e.g., node names, connections) were hard to read or interpret.

## **Monokle**

**Strengths:**

- Monokle’s familiar IDE-like layout and tree/file structure made navigation easy for many users.
- The tool was praised for its detailed information, YAML accessibility, and helpful search features.
- Monokle was considered better for finding specific values and resource distribution.
- The user interface was generally seen as pleasant and modern.

**Weaknesses:**

- The graphical visualization was often described as minimal, cluttered, or hard to interpret.
- Some users found the tool overwhelming due to too much information or too many features.
- The graph view, in particular, was seen as confusing or not useful for understanding service interactions.
- Some participants struggled with the complexity and would have liked better documentation or onboarding.

## **General Feedback**

- Both tools have clear strengths: DeMAF excels in visualization and communication overview, while Monokle is strong in navigation and value finding.
- Users suggested improvements for both, especially regarding UI clarity, documentation, and search functionality.
- The study design was appreciated, with participants enjoying the opportunity to compare two different approaches.
